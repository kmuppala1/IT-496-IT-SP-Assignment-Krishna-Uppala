GitHub

GitHub is an open source project started by Linux creator Linus Torvalds, which is a platform for hosting and collaborating on projects. It is mostly considered as a code sharing service or social networking site for programmers. The best concept in GitHub is there is no need to install any software on the device you are can write the code and you don’t need to worry about storage space. Creating a personal account by signing up in GitHub website can give you the opportunity to write, save and share the code. 
GitHub is used to manage any type of files or documents like MS Word, Power Point or .jpg images, etc.  The repository in the GitHub can store folders and files, anything an assignment/project needs. With each individual repository that is created, a README.txt file can also be included where the description of the project can be provided. 
GitHub has three powerful features: forking, pull request and merge. If a group of people are working on a project together using GitHub, the code of one user can be copied from one user’s account to another account, which is called ‘forking’. If any changes were made in the existing code/work by a user, he/she can send a ‘pull request’ notification to original user/owner. The changes can be saved using the ‘merge’ option. 
Coding can be done using any kind of programming language, but a lot of applications and softwares need to be installed on the computers, which takes a lot of time and storage space. GitHub offers a different approach for coding and managing the data, where there is no need to install any applications and worry about the storage space. The projects can be managed across many computers and can be synced from anywhere. 
Another useful feature GitHub provides is version control, where it takes the snapshots of the file every time a change is made. GitHub is not typically made to programmers or developers. The GUI (graphical user interface) offered by the GitHub makes it easy to use by anyone who would like to save or share the data/work in a day to day life.
